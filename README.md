[Quickstart tutorial sample for Petabridge.Cmd](https://cmd.petabridge.com/articles/quickstart.html).

If you want to use [Petabridge.Cmd](https://cmd.petabridge.com), you can [follow the `pbm` client installation instructions here](https://cmd.petabridge.com/articles/install/index.html) and then you can run it against this sample via the following steps:

1. Execute the `run.cmd` script in the root directory of this repository.
2. Execute the following command after installing `pbm`: `pbm 127.0.0.1:9110`

This will connect you to the `Petabridge.Cmd.Host` running inside the code sample included in this repository. That should give you a feel for how the `pbm` client works AND how to enable `Petabridge.Cmd` from your own Akka.NET `ActorSystem`.
